               TIEDC JUIT continues to be the cradle of technology, innovation and entrepreneurship in Himachal Pradesh, India. Through whole year, this hot-spot continues to brew up many innovative new ideas, which have the potential of creating huge economic returns and lead India to higher economic growth Entrepreneurship Cell invites business ideas from students through its various Business Plan Competitions, and the Innovation Platform. Most of these plans, however, are received in a very crude form and need a lot of expert guidance and support before they can face the competitiveness of the business world. For this, we look up to the alumni and faculty chairperson of our E-cell who have years of experience as students of the institute and hence, can act as the best mentors.

               Indian government has realised the need of new entrepreneurs for development in various fields. In continuation with this, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, is very keen on developing Entrepreneurial Development bodies in all major educational institutions in India. In this regard, Himachal Pradesh Industries under CM Startup Scheme have helped us to grow our E-CELL (Entrepreneurship Cell), TIEDC JUIT stands out as a pioneering organization. Moreover, it is the most active students' organization in Himachal Pradesh. Thus, any association with us will be symbiotic and mutually rewarding to both sides. We had initiated this cell just 1 year before and now it stands as most recognizing community in Himachal Pradesh, India.

                There are various ways in which you get involved.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Mentoring</b>: The B-plans we receive as entries need to be mentored and improved upon, before they can be established as profitable companies. You can act on the advisory board of the company and help with problems pertaining to your area of expertise.<br>
                <br>
        
Angel Investing The most common problem faced by nascent startups is the lack of funds. Many potentially great ideas fizzle out each year due to the sheer lack of funds. We as an incubator supported from the Himachal Pradesh Industries under CM startup scheme will provide you the funding and mentor you at lifetime levels.

                <b>Technology Incubator Entrepreneurship Development Cell</b> is a student body of JUIT who is guided and taken care by our chairperson Mr. Ashish Ruhella. It was formed in December 2016 by Dhruv Batra(our Alumni)  Prakshal Jain( Our Alumni) and Aashray Singal(Currently 4 th year Student) with an idea to eradicate the lack of exposure and build a community where outside people were able to guide our college students and our college students could be able to know the industry requirements. They all took their idea to one faculty Mr.Ashish Rohilla who constantly supported this idea and is now currently the Chairperson of our TIEDC CELL and Nodal officer too.

                <br>For the first flagship event we expanded our team to 5-6 members and now we are a community of 40 working members.
